# SSD Assignment 1

 - I am using Ubuntu.
 - I have used `double square brackets ([[ ]])` for some **condition checks** hence scripts will run in bash but may not run in some other shells.

## Question 1
6. Since the directory named `Assignment1` has **no .txt files** I created some other .txt files for running the command.

# Question 2
 - I have **generated all permutations of characters** provided to test whether such a command exists.
 - I have used `local` keyword so that function calls to `permutate()` have unique variables that are not shared.

# Question 3 
 - **Only the first command** used in a command chain is counted, other commands executing with piping are not counted.

# Question 4
 - The script flattens **only numeric items** provided whether integer or decimal.

# Question 5
 - Used the `rev` command to reverse given string.

# Question 6
 - Used double asterisk `**` for exponentiation.

# Question 7
 - No assumptions.

# Question 8
 - Used `crontab` command for testing validity of given format.
 - Used `crontab -r` to remove task.

# Question 9
 - No assumptions.

# Question 10
 - For division, decimal output does not work so I have used `bc` for that operation only.
 - Other operations are done using `expr` command.
