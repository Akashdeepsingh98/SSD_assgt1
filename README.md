# SSD Assignment 1

 - I am using Ubuntu.
 - I have used `double square brackets ([[ ]])` for some **condition checks** hence scripts will run in bash but may not run in some other shells.

## Question 1
6. Since the directory named `Assignment1` has **no .txt files** I created some other .txt files for running the command.

# Question 2
